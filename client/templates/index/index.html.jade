          h1 Why?
          p.
            Programming languages evolve fast, but converters from old to new ones are stuck in Middle Ages.
              Some of them are:
          ol
            li Insecure — require sending your data to server.
            li Inflexible — restrict to vendor defaults.
            li Immature — can't do batch conversion or process file uploads.
          p.
            Yet, converters are the bridge between past and future.<br/>
              Many programmers are stuck with old languages because it isn't easy to convert existing codebase.
              This must be fixed.
          p: strong Better converters = broader adoption of better languages.
